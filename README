This project aims to provide an easy to setup continuous integration server
and client. The server side infrastructure is built on top of django. The tasks
are described using fabric.

The project is hosted on bitbucket and you can grab the code using mercurial hg

  * hg clone http://bitbucket.org/yml/fabric_factory/

The fabfile at the root of this repository should get you started. In order to
run it you will need the latest version of Fabric that you could install with pip

  * pip install -e git://github.com/bitprophet/fabric.git#egg=Fabric
  * fabfile quickstart

The fabfile at the root of the repository contains a bunch of useful task in the
context of this project. You can explore them by reading the source of this file.

"quickstart" should have created a virtual env that you need to activate.

  * . ve/bin/activate
  
Once the virtualenv is activated you could go inside "src/project" from there
you can do several things :

  * create an sqlite db :  python manage.py syncdb
  * run the server : python manage.py runserver
  * run the test suite : python manage.py test

Once the server is started and that you have created some "Build" in django's
admin interface you should open a new terminal and run the client side of the
project:

  * cd src/worker
  * python run_worker.py
